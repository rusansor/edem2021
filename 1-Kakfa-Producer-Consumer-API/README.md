### IDE
You can choose any of below IDE[(Integrated Development tool)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) you feel more comfortable with. Though we **highly recommend to use IntelliJ** Idea for Big Data technologies based on Scala/Java, and is the one we will use during the training sessions: 

* Follow this [link]( https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download) to install **IntelliJ Idea**. Choose the right version depending on your operative system (Windows, Mac or Linux), and then choose the **Community** free of charge edition.
* [Eclipse]( https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) (Just for your info, it might be possible to use Eclipse for Scala/Kakfa development, but we do not recommend it. At time of writting IntelliI is supperior for this purpouse.)
* [Visual Studio Code]( https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Just for your info, it might be possible to use Eclipse for Scala/Kakfa development, but we do not recommend it. At time of writting IntelliI is supperior for this purpouse.)
